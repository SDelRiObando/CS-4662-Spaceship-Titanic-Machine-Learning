# CS-4662
 In this project, we aim to use a dataset from Kaggle to predict which passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to another dimension due to a spacetime anomaly. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we will analyze passenger records and determine the most effective model for accurate classification.
